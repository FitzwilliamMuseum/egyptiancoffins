Between 15th and 22nd June, six members of the Fitzwilliam Egyptian coffins team travelled to Cairo to undertake the second phase of a knowledge transfer project (generously funded by a grant from the Global Challenges Research Fund) to work with curators and conservators at the Egyptian Museum Cairo on their internationally significant collection of ancient Egyptian coffins. The members of the team were Helen Strudwick, Julie Dawson, Geoffrey Killen, Elsbeth Geldhof, Daniel Pett and Melanie Pitkin. This phase of the project focused on the successful delivery of a 4-day coffin making workshop where 27 participants from the Egyptian Museum Cairo had the opportunity to learn (in a very hands-on fashion!) aspects of ancient Egyptian woodworking, painting, coffin identification and methods for their interpetation and analysis.

Day 1 of the workshop was themed 'Building Coffins' and commenced with an introductory overview to the objectives of the workshop by coffin project leads, Helen Strudwick and Julie Dawson. This was followed by a short presentation delivered by Julie on 'Techniques for examining and identifying coffin construction - a brief introduction and handout', which acquainted participants with the different types of imaging techniques (for example, Computed Tomography/CT scanning, X-radiography, Visible-light Induced Luminescence, Fibre Optic Reflectance Spectroscopy, among others) and how they can be useful in coffin studies. Local Professor of Conservation at Cairo University, Nesrin El-Hadidi, also gave a talk on the different properties and characterstics of wood used in ancient Egyptian coffins, before Dr Geoffrey (Geoff) Killen, expert in ancient Egyptian woodworking, led the remainder of the session by focusing specifically on woodworking and construction techniques.

Geoff opened the afternoon session with an illustrated lecture supported by practical demonstrations on the different types of tools, tool marks and joints used in ancient Egyptian carpentry (the craft replica tools used in this workshop were made by a local Egyptian craftsman to Geoff's drawings and specifications).
