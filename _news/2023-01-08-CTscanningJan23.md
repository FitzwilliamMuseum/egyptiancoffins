This morning, we were able to undertake new CT scanning of part of the [coffin set of Nespawershefyt](https://egyptiancoffins.org/coffins/nespawershefyt). Although we 
have X-radiographed the mummy board in the past, its construction was not absolutely clear. Colleagues at [Addenbrooke's Hospital](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/) 
(part of Cambridge University Hospitals) generously offered to CT scan it out of hours, on a Sunday morning when the scanner would not normally be in use. 
We were very conscious that the scanner might be needed if there was a call for an emergency CT scan to be carried out, in which case we would have immediately got 
out of the way to allow that to happen. Happily nothing like that occurred.

We were able to use a relatively new Siemens scanner, which seemed to be really quick at scanning, and the results we could immediately see on the computer screen 
in the scanning suite looked amazing. In particularly, it looked as if there was something really interesting going on in the area of the face. We are excited to 
see what detailed examination of the scans will show up about how this part of the mummy board was put together. Something else we discovered, not about the mummy board,
was that the sheets we had placed underneath the mummy board to support it appeared to be very similar in density in the first scan we did, which was likely to
make the analysis of the scans a bit awkward. So we replaced them with pillows, and the problem disappeared.

At the same time, we took another part of a coffin to be scanned: the [head end from a yellow coffin](https://data.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/id/object/98444), which is
of a similar date. We have not yet explored this object in a lot of detail. Again, the immediate results from the scans were really promising as we clearly could see how 
the wood had been worked to create the shape of the head end, and the angles of the drill holes. 

We are hugely grateful to Lauren England, CT Radiographer at Addenbrooke's, for giving up her time for this scanning, and to Rob Mackenzie, CT Scanning Manager at 
Addenbrooke's for facilitating the visit today. As usual, we were joined by our brilliant colleague and friend 
[Tom Turmezei](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/tom-turmezei), Consultant Radiologist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. The team from the Fitzwilliam consisted of [Flavia Ravaioli](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/flavia-ravaioli/), [Julie Dawson](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/julie-dawson/) and 
[Helen Strudwick]([https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/julie-dawson/.](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/helen-strudwick/).
