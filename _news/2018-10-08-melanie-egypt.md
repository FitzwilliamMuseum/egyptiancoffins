From 9 to 18th October, Melanie Pitkin travelled to Egypt to give a series of talks about 
the Fitzwilliam Museum's Egyptian coffins project and to 'soft launch' this online coffins 
resource. We were pleased to be able to share the results of our project with colleagues 
from Egypt, but we also wanted to test the new website, which will form the basis of our 
online publication of the Museum's Egyptian coffin collection. Feedback from our colleagues 
enable us to improve the way we present information and to find out what further resources 
people are looking for.
