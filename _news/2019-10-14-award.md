The Fitzwilliam Egyptian coffins team has been awarded the prestigious [Vice-Chancellor's Research Impact and Engagement Award](https://www.research-strategy.admin.cam.ac.uk/impact/vice-chancellors-awards) in the collaboration category for our outreach work on ancient Egyptian coffins. The award, which has been presented annually since 2016, recognises outstanding achievement, innovation and creativity in devising and implementing ambitious engagement and impact plans which have the potential to create significant economic, social and cultural impact from and engagement with and for research. In particular, the award recognised the project team's major 2016 exhibition 'Death on the Nile: Uncovering the afterlife of ancient Egypt', the 'Pop-Up' Museum targeting underserved audiences in England and Egypt and this digital resource.
