In late 2019, the Fitzwilliam Egyptian Coffins project was generously awarded funding from the [Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)](https://www.ukri.org/our-work/collaborating-internationally/global-challenges-research-fund/) for the project titled *Reviving the art of ancient Egyptian mummy portraits in Cairo and the Faiyum: a curatorial, conservation and community collaboration*.  As the title suggests, the aim of this project is to try and revive the craft of Roman-period mummy portraits by empowering colleagues at the Egyptian Museum Cairo (EMC), Kom Aushim Museum in the Faiyum and staff from the Ministry of Antiquities, with deep knowledge in how they were made and decorated to help prepare interpretation materials of their collections for museum audiences and local communities. Another key objective of the project is to share this knowledge with local craftsmen in the Faiyum, connect them to their heritage and potentially boost income and tourism to the area.

The project successfully commenced in the New Year, as intended, with members of the team, [Helen Strudwick](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/helen-strudwick/) (Egyptologist, Fitzwilliam Museum) and [Lucy Wrapson](https://www.hki.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/directory/lucy-wrapson) (Senior Conservator, Hamilton Kerr Institute, Fitzwilliam Museum), travelling to Egypt to meet with local project coordinator, [Sara Hany Abed](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/sara-hany-abed/) and Grand Egyptian Museum Conservator [Nour Mohamed Badr](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nour_Badr), for a 10-day reconnaissance trip. This trip focused on surveying some of the EMC’s collection of Roman-period mummy portraits and selecting one for an experimental recreation which forms the basis of two workshops (in Cairo and the Faiyum) to train Egyptian colleagues in the production and decoration of the mummy portraits. As part of this, the trip also sought to identify appropriate venues (bearing in mind the recreated mummy portrait involves using hot wax over a flame), collecting and purchasing materials to use in the workshops and meeting staff at the respective venues – especially Kom Aushim Museum, the Faiyum Tourism Authority and local Faiyum arts and crafts community since they are all new project partners for us.

Shortly following this trip, however, the world changed and so did the nature of our project. Suddenly, we were presented with devising new ways to re-work our project into a COVID-friendly manner. Namely, by delivering our workshops remotely online rather than in-person. In light of this, we have been working with local Cambridgeshire-based filmmaker [Gavin Toomey](https://www.gavintoomey.com/info) to develop three training videos – (1) on the preparation and carpentry of the wood on which the portraits were painted (presented by [Dr Geoffrey Killen](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/geoff-killen/)); (2) pigments, painting and the order in which the portraits were painted (presented by Dr Lucy Wrapson); and (3) how to setup and deliver a ‘Pop-Up’ Museum on the topic of Roman-period mummy portraits (presented by Helen Strudwick and [Melanie Pitkin](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/melanie-pitkin/). 

The first workshop to be delivered remotely by the Fitzwilliam team is scheduled to take place in May 2021 with a group of EMC curators and conservators. After participating in the 2-day workshop, which will involve Sara and Nour leading the demonstrations of the recreation in-person, this group will travel south to lead the training of their Faiyum colleagues and the local arts and crafts community. Members of the Fitzwilliam Museum’s project team in the UK will be on hand to provide support. This arrangement is part of a peer-to-peer training network we have been implementing since 2019 designed to empower and upskill our Egyptian colleagues, enabling wider reach to this knowledge from audiences in more geographically diverse locations.

Over the coming months, we will continue to document the progress and impact of this project both here and via the hashtag #fitzmummyportraits on Twitter.
