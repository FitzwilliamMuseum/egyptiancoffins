A small team from the Fitzwilliam Egyptian coffins project recently travelled to Cairo (July 16-22, 2019) to pilot their successful 'Pop-Up' Egyptian coffins Museum with colleagues at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square. The team comprised [Helen Strudwick](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/helen-strudwick/), [Melanie Pitkin](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/melanie-pitkin/), [Charlotte Thompson-Mitchell](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/charlotte-thompson/) and our local contact and Project Manager in Egypt, Sara Hany Abed.

Following on from our previous visits to Egypt with the generous support of the [Global Challenges Research Fund](https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/), which focused on sharing our methodologies and findings from our research into the Fitzwilliam Museum's Egyptian coffins collection in an interactive, hands-on manner (as described [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/new-collaborative-project-with-the-Egyptian-Museum-Cairo) and [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/cairoworkshop)), this trip was all about how we can share this academic work with non-academic audiences through community outreach and engagement.
