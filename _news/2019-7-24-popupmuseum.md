A small team from the Fitzwilliam Egyptian coffins project recently travelled to Cairo (July 16-22, 2019) to pilot their successful 'Pop-Up' Egyptian coffins Museum with colleagues at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square. The team comprised [Helen Strudwick](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/helen-strudwick/), [Melanie Pitkin](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/melanie-pitkin/), [Charlotte Thompson-Mitchell](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/charlotte-thompson/) and our local contact and Project Manager in Egypt, Sara Hany Abed.

Following on from our previous visits to Egypt generously supported by the [Global Challenges Research Fund](https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/), which focused on sharing our methodologies and findings from our research into the Fitzwilliam Museum's Egyptian coffins collection in an interactive, hands-on manner (as described [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/new-collaborative-project-with-the-Egyptian-Museum-Cairo) and [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/cairoworkshop)), this trip concentrated on one proven successful outreach model to engage non-academic audiences in academic research - namely, the 'Pop-Up' Museum. 

As you will read [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/pop-ups), a 'Pop-Up' Museum is where real researchers (including Egyptologists and conservators) bring real museum objects, craft replicas, hands-on activities and digital experiences into the heart of communities who might not otherwise have access to our research. We aim to do this, however, in surprising ways by popping-up in locations where people would not expect to have a cultural encounter. For example, in our 6-month project in Wisbech, England generously supported by the Arts and Humanities Impact Fund, we popped-up in a pub, supermarket, shopping centre, public thoroughfare and a food bank. 

We wanted to replicate this approach in Cairo with our colleagues at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square to show the value and importance of taking research beyond the museum's walls, particularly when you are able to reach new and diverse audiences in intimate and personable ways. The benefits are also wide-reaching - not only in raising research awareness, but in helping to improve peoples' happiness and well-being. 

Thus, our time in Cairo consisted of three parts: (1) A training session and live demonstration of the 'Pop-Up' Egyptian coffins project with curators, conservators and students at the Egyptian Museum Cairo (Thursday 18th July); (2) Delivery of a 'Pop-Up' Museum in the Pinocchio furniture store in Maadi (Friday 19th July) and (3) A debrief and discussion over koshary of the impact our GCRF funded work has had on our Egyptian Museum colleagues' work practices both now and in the future (Sunday 21st July). A summary of these events are as follows:

*Thursday 18th July*
From 12noon-1pm in Gallery 39 at the Egyptian Museum Cairo, Melanie Pitkin, Sara Hany Abed and Charlotte Thompson-Mitchell delivered a bilingual English-Arabic lecture titled 'The Pop-Up Egyptian Coffins Project. A method for engaging non-academic audiences in academic research'. The lecture was well-attended by 27 Egyptian Museum curators and conservators, as well as a group of conservation students from Cairo University currently training with the Egyptian Museum's Head of Conservation, Dr Moamen Othmann. 

Following the lecture, participants helped to setup the 'Pop-Up' near the Museum's exit. Melanie, Charlotte and Sara then demonstrated all the different components and experiences of the 'Pop-Up' for participants before our Egyptian colleagues took the reigns to deliver the content to Museum visitors themselves. It was fabulous to see how enthusiastic all the participants were. In a space of 3 hours, we recorded 45 meaningful engagements with visitors (of 3 minutes or longer), but made impressions on a further 600 passers-by. 

Some particular highlights included a group of American tourists who said their encounter with the 'Pop-Up' Egyptian Coffins project "made their visit to the Museum"! They also asked to pose for photographs with Egyptian coffins team. We also received two Chinese tourists with their Egyptian tour guide who methodically translated all of Sara's explanations from Arabic into Mandarin. They spent at least 20 minutes engrossed by the content, especially the replica section of Nespawershefyt's coffin lid showing the different surface preparation and pigment layers making up its decoration. It was also very rewarding to observe the number of conversations happening in Arabic between our Egyptian colleagues and local Egyptian Museum visitors. The whole objective of the 'Pop-Up' training is to equip our Egyptian colleagues with the knowledge, confidence and infrastructure to deliver these experiences on their own with a particular focus on engaging Egyptian communities and helping them to re-discover (or newly discover) their cultural heritage and identities.  

*Friday 19th July*


The Fitzwilliam-EMC coffins teams would like to extend a very warm thank you to Amr and Marwa of Pinocchio Furniture for their incredibly kind support of our project and for allowing us to use their furniture store in Maadi for our debut Cairo 'Pop-Up'.
