Today Fitzwilliam cares for a vast and varied collection of objects ranging from Ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman antiquities to the arts of the present day. It has one of the finest collections of paintings, drawings and prints in Britain, and significant collections of Asian art, medieval illuminated manuscripts, and outstanding collections of applied arts, pottery, porcelain and medieval coins.

It is a UK leader in fine-art conservation, and its Hamilton Kerr Institute is one of the world’s foremost centres for teaching in the conservation of easel paintings.

Our mission The Fitzwilliam Museum is the principal museum of the University of Cambridge and leads the University of Cambridge Museums (UCM) consortium, an Arts Council England funded National Portfolio Organisation.

The UCM consortium brings together eight University Museums and the Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Together, they represent the UK’s highest concentration of internationally important collections outside London. With more than five million works of art, artefacts, and specimens, the collections span four and a half billion years. Close to a million people of all ages and backgrounds participate in events for our extensive public, educational and outreach programme every year.

Our mission is to contribute to society through the pursuit of education, learning and research at the highest international levels of excellence. We do this by preserving and extending our world‐class collections and buildings, and by offering public programmes to engage with as wide an audience as possible.

We aim to be one of the leading University Museums in the world. We are known internationally for: exemplary collections and exhibitions; exceptional research; high standards of curatorial and conservation work; and a creative, inclusive and impactful learning service. We strive to be innovators in the enhancement of learning.

Through local partnerships we play a role in making the city and region a better place to live, work and visit.

In 2016, we celebrated our Bicentenary and as we enter our third century we have embarked on a major Master Plan for the future.

The Fitzwilliam is a Non‐School Institution of the University, overseen by the University’s General Board and governed by the Fitzwilliam Museum Syndicate, a General Board committee.
