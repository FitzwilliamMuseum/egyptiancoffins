In February 2019, the Fitzwilliam Museum, University of Cambridge hosted a colloquium entitled "Reuse, Appropriation and Ownership in Ancient Egypt: framing our understanding". This built on the identificaiton of reuse of wood in coffin production, but expanded on the subject to explore the way that other material culture in Egypt was reused, e.g. re-writing inscriptions and re-inscribing royal statues, reuse of tombs.

The themes of the conference focused on three areas:

* Past: the development of coffins in antiquity, including technological, iconographic and text-based studies
* Present: the post-antiquity history of coffins
* Future: developments in the technical examination and analysis of coffins

The conference language was in English and was attended by over one hundred delegates from seventeen countries. The quality and quantity of papers proposed for the conference was extremely high. This meant that the organisers were forced to ask a large number of participants to present their work in the form of a poster, rather than as a spoken presentation. Happily, all the colleagues affected generously consented to this proposal. Abstracts of the posters are included in the publication of the conference proceedings, published by Oxbow Books Ltd, which can be purchased [here](https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Egyptian-Coffins-Present-Future/dp/1785709186).

The conference was preceded by a three-day practical event (The Coffins Workshop) at which a number of additional posters were presented. You can view these by clicking on the links to the right of this text.
