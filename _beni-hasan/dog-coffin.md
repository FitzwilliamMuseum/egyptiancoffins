**Object number:** E.47.1902

**Description:** This small wooden box coffin, believed to be for a dog, was discovered by John Garstang at Beni Hasan and gifted to the Museum in 1902. The coffin is made from twelve pieces of Lebanese cedar wood (_Cedrus Libani_), although only eight are preserved, with mitred corners held together by dowels. The exterior of the coffin is painted yellow with a band of hieroglyphic text extending around each side and on the lid. The text indicates the owner of the coffin was named Heb.

**Measurements:** H. 27cm x W. 70cm x D. 20cm.

**Analysis:** Coming soon.

**Commentary:** A replica of this coffin was made by ancient woodworking specialist, Dr Geoffrey Killen, in March 2019 for a 'Pop-Up' Egyptian Coffins outreach project in Wisbech and the Fens. The video below shows a time lapse of this work, and below that you can view images of the construction process.

**Bibliography:** The coffin was published by Angela Tooley in the 1988 edition of the [_Journal of Egyptian Archaeology_](https://www.academia.edu/755703/_Coffin_of_a_dog_from_Beni_Hasan_JEA_74_1988_207-211_pls._XXVI_2_XXVII_1-2).
