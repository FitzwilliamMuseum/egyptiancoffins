**Object number:** E.67.1903

**Description:** Four panels from an outer coffin, box-shaped, made of painted wood belonging to a man named User-heta (or Heta-user) from Beni Hasan, Middle Egypt. The coffin dates to the 12th Dynasty, Middle Kingdom (around 1938 - 1756 BC). The coffin is missing the lid and the base; only the sides are present, all with the uppermost part missing, including the horizontal text lines. Most of the dowels are missing. The short sides are fairly intact, each made of two planks, joined by two long dowels which survive. The front is full-length and almost complete, only a short upper section is missing. 

**Measurements:** Front: l. 205.5 cm w. 36 cm d. 4 cm; Back: l. 205.4 cm w. 20.2 cm d. 4 cm; P.l. end board: l. 49 cm w. 41 cm d. 3.5 cm; P.r. end bord: l. 49 cm w. 36.4 cm d. 3.5 cm 

**Analysis:** The front panel is made of a single, wide plank, which shows severe termite damage around both ends. Termite channels also run lengthwise along the middle section. Rot is visible in the same area. Of the back of the coffin, only part of the lower plank survives, again with severe termite damage.  

The paint layers are mostly in very good condition.  Some areas have suffered water damage (e.g., the lower edge of the p.l end), but there is very little paint loss which is not associated with damage to the wood.  There is little or no ground underneath most of the paint, with the exception of old holes that have been filled with a thick plaster. This paint is water damaged in areas and is poorly bound. It is also very vulnerable to loss from contact.

Pigments were examined with XRF. Preliminary results show a limited palette with Egyptian blue, (probable) Egyptian green, red earth and a yellow earth, occasionally mixed with calcite to alter the hue. The final outlining is carried out in a char carbon black. 

**Commentary:** 
The coffin panel shows evidence for reuse in three main ways –
(1)	The original name of the owner appears to have been wiped away. Without further technical analysis, however, it is not yet possible to discern what the name was. The name of the ‘new’ coffin’s owner which appears there now is to be read either User-heta or Heta-user.  Although neither reading of the name appears in [Scheele-Schweitzer](https://pnm.uni-mainz.de/1/names?name=wsr&translation=&match=inexact&match-region=attested&place=&match-date=strictly&period=&gender=any&ranke=&form_type=&sem_type=) (2014) or Ranke, *Personennamen*.

(2)	About half-way down on the proper right side of the panel we can also see evidence of patching by means of a square piece of wood which has been secured in place (we are still to examine how the patch is held in place). There was clearly a hole in the wood at this point (whether caused by a knot or its previous use in another structure) that was filled with a smaller piece of wood. 

(3)	While re-examining the coffin panel prior to and during an international workshop on reuse organised by the Museum and held at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research in February 2019, some further interesting observations were made. All four panels from this coffin have a series of very large holes (much larger than normal dowel holes), which were most probably used to connect these pieces of wood to a transversal wooden plank. These holes would have been filled with some kind of paste or wooden patches when the wood was made into a coffin. There are also some very large mortise and tenons joints, which can be seen on the edges and on the back of the pieces of wood and are even more visible in the X-radiographs. It is clear that this panel was originally used for a much larger, sturdier structure – such as a door. Geoff Killen and John Taylor both confirm that the arrangement of the mortise and tenon joints and the large dowel holes conform to the construction of a wooden door in the British Museum.
