**Object number:** E.67.1903

**Description:** Four panels from an outer coffin (without lid), box-shaped, made of painted wood belonging to a man named User-heta (or Heta-user) from Beni Hasan, Middle Egypt. The coffin dates to the 12th Dynasty, Middle Kingdom (around 1938 - 1756 BC). 

**Evidence for reuse:** 
There are three main points for discussion in relation to the end panel –
(1)	The original name of the owner appears to have been wiped away. Without further technical analysis, however, it is not yet possible to discern what the name was. The name of the ‘new’ coffin’s owner which appears there now is to be read either User-heta or Heta-user.  Although neither reading of the name appears in [Scheele-Schweitzer](https://pnm.uni-mainz.de/1/names?name=wsr&translation=&match=inexact&match-region=attested&place=&match-date=strictly&period=&gender=any&ranke=&form_type=&sem_type=) (2014) or Ranke, *Personennamen*.
(2)	About half-way down on the proper right side of the panel we can also see evidence of patching by means of a square piece of wood which has been secured in place (we are still to examine how the patch is held in place). There was clearly a hole in the wood at this point (whether caused by a knot or its previous use in another structure) that was filled with a smaller piece of wood. 
(3)	While re-examining the coffin panel prior to and during an international workshop on reuse organised by the Museum and held at the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research in February 2019, some further interesting observations were made. All four panels from this coffin have a series of very large holes (much larger than normal dowel holes), which were most probably used to connect these pieces of wood to a transversal wooden plank. These holes would have been filled with some kind of paste or wooden patches when the wood was made into a coffin. There are also some very large mortise and tenons joints, which can be seen on the edges and on the back of the pieces of wood and are even more visible in the X-radiographs. It is clear that this panel was originally used for a much larger, sturdier structure – such as a door. Geoff Killen and John Taylor both confirm that the arrangement of the mortise and tenon joints and the large dowel holes conform to the construction of a wooden door in the British Museum.
