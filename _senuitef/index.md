The long boards grouped under this accession number belong to the coffin of Senu-itif. 
(FN Name not in Ranke, Personennamen) The boards from the short sides may belong to a 
different coffin. The long boards, with their four vertical columns, conform to Willems'
type IV, while each short end piece with its single vertical column belongs to type III.
  
The latter also give the name of a different person, Warethetep, confirming the impression
that they belong to another coffin. Since the coffin comes from a tomb that contained 
several burials, it is possible that, while emptying the tomb, pieces from two different 
coffins were merged together for selling to a museum.

(CHECK WITH WOLFRAM: but it wasn't being sold to a museum; it went to Hilton Price; 
Janine B has suggested that the coffin may have got messed up when it was being assembled
 originally).
