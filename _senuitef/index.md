## Brief description 

The long boards grouped under this accession number belong to the coffin of a person named Senu-itif. 
However, the boards from the short sides give the name of the owner as Warethetep. 
The texts on the long boards are arranged in four vertical columns. This is an arrangement that Wolfram Grajetzki 
suggests is later in date to the arrangement of the texts on the short boards, which are written in a single vertical column.
  
It is not clear why two people are named on these fragments of coffin. The tomb in which they were found contained several burials, 
so it may be that two coffins were confused by the people clearing out the tomb. 
Or perhaps the parts were wrongly assembled originally. Another option could be that the short ends of the coffin were taken
from an earlier coffin that was no longer needed, but the inscriptions were not changed. In that case, study of the dowel holes 
connecting the pieces of the coffin might provide some assistance in clarifying the picture. However, so far the evidence
has not helped to us understand why two people are named on the pieces of this coffin, and why they are apparently slightly different 
in date.
