**Further dating information about this object**

The only clue for dating the coffin is the sequence of coffin texts on
this board. They are almost identical to the spells on the coffin of the
'mayor' Mesehti. The date of Mesehti is not firmly established but he
belongs most likely before the Eleventh Dynasty.
