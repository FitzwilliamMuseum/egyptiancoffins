**Further dating information about this object was found**

The mummy to which the foot-case belongs was found by Sir William
Matthew Flinders Petrie during his excavations at Hawara in the Faiyum.
It was placed within a two-room tomb with five other bodies, a further
two being placed one on top of the other in a smaller chamber. Petrie
wrote in his publication of the finds: '[Grave] F was a unique burial
with cartonnage head-piece unusually large, having a wreath of loose
leaves of gilt canvas and green berries between them, in the hands a red
wreath and a candle. The rhombic bandage was in five layers with gilt
buttons, and two rows of buttons on the chest. The foot-case was gilt.
(Cambridge).' The whereabouts of the mummy with its
'rhombic' dressings is unknown and it may have been left on the site.
