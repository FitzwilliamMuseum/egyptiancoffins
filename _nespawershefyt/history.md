Nespawershefyt’s coffin set was one of the first objects to be acquired into the
fledgling Fitzwilliam Museum’s ancient Egyptian collection. Gifted to the Museum by
former Trinity College students, [Barnard Hanbury (1793-1833) and George Waddington
(1793-1869)](https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/collections/egypt/collectionhistory/hanbury_waddington) in 1822, the coffins were acquired by the pair during their travels. While
we know these travels included a voyage between Wadi Halfa and Meroe as documented in
their travel diary titled, _Journal of a Visit to some parts of Ethiopia_, almost nothing
else is known at present about their time in Egypt.

In addition to Nespawershefyt’s coffin set, Hanbury and Waddington gifted to the Museum
the Ramesside granite sarcophagus of [Hunefer](http://webapps.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/explorer/index.php?qu=ObjectNumber:E.1.1835&oid=49039) in 1835 (E.1.1835). Given that one of the
fragments from the ‘lost’ tomb of Nebamun was also collected in Egypt by Hanbury and
Waddington and presented to the British Museum in 1833 by Sir Henry Ellis, it would seem
 that the death of Hanbury may have motivated the sale of further objects from their
 collection.
