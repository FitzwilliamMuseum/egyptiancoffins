Nespawershefyt’s coffin set was one of the first objects to be acquired into the 
fledgling Fitzwilliam Museum’s ancient Egyptian collection. Gifted to the Museum by 
former Trinity College students, Barnard Hanbury (1793-1833) and George Waddington 
(1793-1869) in 1822, the coffins were acquired by the pair during their travels. While 
we know these travels included a voyage between Wadi Halfa and Meroe as documented in 
their travel diary titled, Journal of a Visit to some parts of Ethiopia, almost nothing 
else is known at present about their time in Egypt.

In addition to Nespawershefyt’s coffin set, Hanbury and Waddington gifted to the Museum 
the Ramesside granite sarcophagus of Hunefer in 1835 (E.1.1835). Given that one of the 
fragments from the ‘lost’ tomb of Nebamun was also collected in Egypt by Hanbury and 
Waddington and presented to the British Museum in 1833 by Sir Henry Ellis, it would seem
 that the death of Hanbury may have motivated the sale of further objects from their 
 collection.
