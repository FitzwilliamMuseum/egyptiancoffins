The technical expertise demonstrated by the craftsmen and the aesthetic effect achieved 
on Nespawershefyt’s coffin set is exceptional. Using a very limited, but bold palette, 
the decoration has been painted onto one or more layers of calcite paste applied to the 
wooden carcass over strips of linen fabric. The painting was carried out using a variety 
of pens made from single hollow stems and brushes made from plant fibres or sticks of 
fibrous wood bundled together.

A very thin wash of lemon yellow orpiment (an arsenic sulphide mineral commonly used as a 
substitute to gold) was applied over the white preparation layer on the mummy board and 
inner coffin, while the white layer has been left exposed as the background on the outer 
coffin. The rear of the mummy board is painted a deep red-brown.

The outline for the decoration and text was laid out with great care and precision using
 red earth paint (a few setting out lines in black also appear on the inner coffin box). 
 After the drawing was complete, the red, blue and green areas of the design were filled 
 in. Each colour was applied in turn; suggesting a single batch of paint was produced and
  used across the coffin in the workshop before mixing the next colour. This may have 
  been because the gums and glue mixed with the pigments to make paint had a tendency 
  to congeal, dry or need re-heating.

The different blue and green shapes in the text and iconography have been built up in high
 relief and details such as the outlines for the eyes, mouths and beards have been added
  in black. The irises of the eyes are white. The overall decoration and text has been varnished using a natural tree resin (pistacia resin), sometimes also known as mastic. This adds a high gloss finish to the coffins and saturates the colours, although we still have little understanding about how the ancient Egyptians actually applied it.

There are several clues in the paint and varnish to indicate how the painter oriented the coffin during the painting process. For example, the Egyptian blue and green pigments were often applied thickly as a viscous paint which tended to gather in incipient drips as it dried. Based on this, it is perhaps no surprise then that the interiors of the coffin boxes appear to have been painted standing upright on the foot ends, while the scenes of the exterior sides were painted with the boxes lying flat on their base boards.

The craftsmen have also left a number of very human touches on Nespawershefyt’s coffin set. Some fingerprints, for example, appear in the varnished surface on the upper side of the mummy board and on the underside of the inner coffin lid rim there are handprints where someone with their hands covered in varnish, picked up the lid. There is also a small protective wedjat-eye sign doodled on the underside of the inner coffin box.
