## Accommodation

As this conference will be held during term time in Cambridge we are unable to offer accommodation within any of the colleges. In-person participants will need to make their own arrangements, but there are many hotels and other types of accommodation in Cambridge, which is a popular tourist destination. 

The organisers will post a list of possible places soon.
