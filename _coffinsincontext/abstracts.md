The deadline for submission of abstracts has now passed. Thank you to everyone who has submitted a paper or poster. We have been overwhelmed by the positive response.

The draft programme of the conference is [available here](../Draft_programme_online1.pdf). This may change over the next few weeks and we will 
update it regularly.

We are compiling a complete set of abstracts and this will be published shortly.
