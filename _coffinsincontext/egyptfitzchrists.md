## Egyptology at The Fitzwilliam Museum and in Christ’s College

The [Fitzwilliam Museum](https://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk) houses one of the four major collections of Egyptian antiquities in the United Kingdom, with objects from Predynastic Egypt through to the Islamic Period. In recent years, the Museum has undertaken an intensive multidisciplinary project into its collection of coffins, involving the Fitzwilliam’s own researchers in conservation and Egyptology and experts from outside the Museum. More information is available on this website.

[Christ’s College](https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk) has the richest tradition in Egyptology among the Colleges of the University of Cambridge and is an international Egyptology hub. It is the home of the Lady Wallis Budge Fellowship in Egyptology, which has funded continuous research into Ancient Egypt at the College since 1934. During this time, the College has employed twelve Egyptologists, who have worked across ten countries and five continents, as well as training numerous students and hosting the international Wallis Budge Egyptology symposia.
