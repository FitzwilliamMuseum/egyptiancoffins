## Conference Format

The conference language will be English. 

Papers will last no more than 20 minutes, and will be grouped together in appropriate sessions. There will also be a poster session. 

The conference will be hybrid; details about how to connect will be shared in due course.

The conference will conclude with a plenary discussion on where coffin studies might go next.
