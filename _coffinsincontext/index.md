The Fitzwilliam Museum and Christ’s College, Cambridge are pleased to announce a conference on ancient Egyptian coffins from Thursday 22 to Saturday 24 February 2024. 

Our previous conference in 2016 (Ancient Egyptian Coffins: past • present • future) focussed on the development of coffins in antiquity, including technological, iconographic and text-based studies, the post-antiquity history of coffins and developments in their technical examination and analysis. Since then, studies have moved on, with numerous institutions around the world carrying out comprehensive investigations of the coffins in their collections. This seems a good opportunity to pause and consider what we have learned and the direction of future coffin research.
