**Brief description:** 

Nephthys is shown here crouching on the "gold" hieroglyph, with the hieroglyphs that spell her name on her head. Depictions of Nephthys and Isis were included on coffins to provide protection to the body inside, in the same way that these goddesses protected Osiris's body. 

Fragment of a wooden coffin board, made of two pieces of wood. Nephthys is sitting on a nub (gold) sign.
Here arms are raised. The figure is painted in black outlines; details are in red and green. The skin
is left unpainted. The piece comes perhaps from the head end of a coffin box.
