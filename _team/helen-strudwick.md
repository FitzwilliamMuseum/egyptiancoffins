Helen Strudwick is Senior Curator (Ancient Nile Valley) at the Fitzwilliam Museum and is responsible for the Museum’s collection of Egyptian Antiquities. 
Since 2014, with Julie Dawson (Leverhulme Emeritus Fellow and Affiliated Researcher), she has a led a project to study, document and publish information about 
the Fitzwilliam’s collection of Egyptian coffins.

She first joined the Department of Antiquities in 2001 as an Egyptologist, working in documentation of the collections, as a dedicated outreach officer for ancient Egypt
and then as acting Senior Assistant Keeper. In 2009 she became the Fitzwilliam’s first exhibitions officer, a post she held until her return to Antiquities in 2014.

Working with [Julie Dawson](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/julie-dawson/) (former Head of Conservation at the Fitzwilliam), she curated a major exhibition on ancient
Egyptian coffins and the funerary industry in 2016 called *Death on the Nile: Uncovering the Afterlife of Ancient Egypt*. She also co-authored an exhibition catalogue 
of the same name.

Helen has also been archaeological director of the [Cambridge Theban Tomb mission](http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/tt99) which has worked in Luxor since 1984 on a 
long-term project to document private tombs endangered by theft, tourism and environmental damage. So far the project has recorded Theban tombs 99, 253, 254, 294 
and 297. 

She is passionate about sharing information about ancient Egypt, not only with other Egyptologists but with people from all walks of life and is a regular lecturer 
at day schools and events run by local Egyptology societies.
