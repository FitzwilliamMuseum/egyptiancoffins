Host of the Royal College of Radiologists [CRASH! Podcast](https://rcrcrash.podbean.com/) 

Tom's clinical interests are in musculoskeletal imaging and intervention, and his research focusses on 3-D imaging analysis in musculoskeletal disease. Before becoming
involved with Egyptian coffins, he had skillfully tackled the challenges involved in CT scanning artists' mannequins for the Fitzwilliam's *Silent Partners* exhibition.
He then went on to work closely with the project team putting together the 2016 [*Death on the Nile* exhibition](https://egyptiancoffins.org/deathonthenile), which 
included dedicating hours of his spare time to preparing fabulous imagery of the coffins of Nespawershefyt for the exhibition and the accompanying catalogue.
