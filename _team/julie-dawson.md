Until her retirement in May 2021, Julie Dawson was Head of Conservation and Scientific Research at the Museum and was co-lead with Helen Strudwick on the Egyptian Coffins Project from 2014. 

In 2021 Julie was awarded a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship for two years to continue her research on Egyptian coffins and she is now an Affiliated Researcher 
at the Fitzwilliam. This is enabling Julie’s continued contribution to the project as a whole, focussing on enhancing the online resource as well 
as following up on two distinct research strands that help open up our understanding 
of Egyptian society, economy and religion over a broad period of time:  

1. Studies of coffin reuse (including our own) have concentrated on the late-20th to 21st Dynasty (1090–945 BCE). However, the project has shown the phenomenon is more widespread. Dawson will complete investigation of the original technology and physical evidence of recycling of our Middle Kingdom (c.2010–1650 BCE) coffins. Combined with Egyptological studies of funerary culture in this period and the preceding First Intermediate Period, this strand of work will help place coffins more precisely in their social, cultural and religious contexts, and examine differences in reuse chronologically between the 'intermediate' periods and more settled kingdoms. 
 
2. Cartonnage, a free-standing moulded material, made of layers of linen, glue and plaster, was in use in Egypt from at least the Middle Kingdom. The project has shown that a complex structure overlying a 7th century BCE coffin in the collection resembles a ‘true’ cartonnage mummy case of the Third Intermediate Period (1070–735 BCE) but moulded onto a wooden carcass. Numerous variants of this previously unstudied phenomenon have now been observed in other collections. This strand of work will investigate further the technological development and properties of cartonnage and this ‘pseudo-cartonnage’. By establishing a framework of production and use, these materials can be contrasted, enabling evaluation of constructional function as well as religious/social significance.

Julie is an archaeological conservator with particular interests in the technology and conservation of ancient Egyptian material. Her focus in the coffins’ project 
is construction and decoration techniques, reuse and recycling of materials to make new new coffins and investigation through computed tomography (CT) 
and microCT scanning.

In addition to her role at the Fitzwilliam Museum, she works in Egypt, formerly in the tomb of Senneferi (TT99) at Luxor with Helen and Nigel Strudwick and, since 2007, as co-leader of the coffin conservation project at Amarna.
