## Brief description

* Accession number E.64.1896
* Other numbers and markings: None

The mummy case of Nakhtefmut is constructed of cartonnage and was found in excavations by Quibell at the Ramesseum in 1896.
The burial was intact. The mummy case, with the body of Nakhtefmut inside, was found inside three wooden coffins,
as described by Quibell as follows:

> On the outer coffin of this personage, above the chest, stood a jackal in wood. Inside this was a second coffin, upon
which lay a hawk in painted wood. This second coffin had an inscription painted down the centre. Inside this was yet an
innermost coffin, covered with wreaths made of the leaves of mimusops.
