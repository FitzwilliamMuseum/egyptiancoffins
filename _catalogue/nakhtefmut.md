#### Find context

Nakhtefmut's burial was found intact by J.E. Quibell. The mummy case, with the body of Nakhtefmut inside, was found inside three wooden coffins whose fate is not known.

Quibell describes their discovery as follows:

"On the outer coffin of this personage, above the chest, stood a jackal in wood. Inside this was a second coffin, upon
which lay a hawk in painted wood. This second coffin had an inscription painted down the centre. Inside this was yet an
innermost coffin, covered with wreaths made of the leaves of mimusops. Two ropes lay along the sides, and the wreaths were joined to them like the rungs of a ladder"
<br>(Quibell, *The Ramesseum*, pp 10-11.)
