[The Wheatsheaf Inn](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/cambridgeshire/the-wheatsheaf-inn-wisbech), owned by Wetherspoon's pub, has been one of our best received Pop-Up locations. With huge thanks to Manager Martin Baldwin, we held four Pop-Ups here on March 19, 21, 26 and June 26, 2019. 

During our four Pop-Up sessions at the pub (which, quite fittingly, is the former site of a furniture and decorating store), we had over 100 meaningful engagements (3 minutes or more) and over 300 impressions (engagements of 3 minutes or less, including passers-by). One of the more rewarding aspects of this venue was getting to know regular pubgoers, including Nicky, his Mum, Sally, and Grandmother, Mary - pictured below.  

The Egyptian Coffins Pop-Up Museum featured in the [Wetherspoon News](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/wetherspoonnews) magazine in June-August 2019, which has a readership of over 2 million! We were also interviewed by [BBC Cambridgeshire radio](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-47720757) in late March.
