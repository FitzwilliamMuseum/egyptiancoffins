On the 24th of April, we took our pop-up to [Morrisons Supermarket](https://my.morrisons.com/storefinder/511). Morrisons is a major supermarket retailer in the U.K, with over 500 stores across the country. Wisbech Morrisons lies outside of the town centre. It was made clear from our visitors that people in this part of town do not visit Wisbech town centre very often due to a dislike of the town and its anti-social behaviour and crime levels. 

It is estimated that we made impressions on at least 1100 people during our 3-hour Pop-Up session at the supermarket. However, we only had 33 meaningful engagements with shoppers, much less than anticipated. One reason for this could be because visitors assumed that we were a charity or sales stand and thus treated us with suspicion! A lot of people were on a time constraint, eager to get their shopping done and to escape the chaos of a busy store. 

A significant person involved in our Morrisons Pop-Up was Debbie. Debbie is the Community Champion for the Wisbech store and she helped facilitate our Pop-Up. Her job as a Community Champion is to connect the store with the surrounding community by fundraising and volunteering.
