On June 12, 2019 the Pop-Up Egyptian coffins project brought their research to the [Wisbech Baptist Church](http://www.wisbechbaptistchurch.org.uk/) where every Monday, Wednesday and Friday (during specified hours) [The Trussell Trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/) run a food bank. The Wisbech Food Bank gave 3006 emergency food supplies and support to people in need throughout 2018.

We were situated in the main entrance area of the church which made us more accessible to passers-by. The food bank was open between 14:00-16:00 on the day of the Pop-Up, so we anticipated to have minimal visitors before 2 pm. We enticed a few passers-by to visit the pop-up through word-of-mouth in the street outside the church.

Even though the visitors to the food bank didnâ€™t interact with the Pop-Up as much as we hoped, our presence still made an impression on approximately 20 people passing through. A recurring theme of conversation at the Foodbank Pop-Up was knife-crime, something we had not experienced at any of our other venues and which was incited by our replica tool display, which features a replica pull saw.
