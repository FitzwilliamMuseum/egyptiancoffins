The [Oasis Community Centre](http://wisbechcommunitydevelopmenttrust.btck.co.uk/) is a community centre based in the Waterlees Ward of Wisbech, which is the most deprived ward in Cambridgeshire with approximately 4900 residents. It is owned and run by the Wisbech Community Development Trust and is made up of local residents as well as representatives from public and private organisations. The centre's vision is to provide support and activities that encompass all age groups, abilities, interests and needs of the local people. 

On the 29th May 2019 we popped-up outside of the Oasis Community Centre. It was half-term, so there were some activities for children and families inside the centre and this influenced our demographic. We were keen to find out how the audience at this venue compares to the [Rosmini Community Centre](https://egyptiancoffins.org/pop-ups/rosmini-community). We had approximately 20 meaningful engagements with visitors (3 minutes or more) and made impressions (an engagement of fewer than 3 minutes, including glances by passers-by) on an estimated 30 people. The majority of visitors were young families with young children, and people over 60. The majority of adults that engaged with us were female. 


A seven-year-old boy was particularly intrigued by our pop-up! He first spent some time cycling past the Oasis Community Centre before deciding to approach us. He was interested in the coffin fragments on display and wanted to replicate what he saw. He spent about an hour with us, first making a paintbrush, then painstakingly painting, ensuring the colours were exact and making sure he didnâ€™t paint outside of the lines!
