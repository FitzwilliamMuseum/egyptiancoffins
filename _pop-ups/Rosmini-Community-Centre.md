The Rosmini Community Centre is a community based organisation in Wisbech which provides employment support and translation services, legal advice, community transport and a range of activities spanning basketball, table tennis, woodworking and day trips. Located on Queens Road, on the other side of the town to the Oasis Community Centre, it provides a particular refuge for Wisbech's migrant communities, who predominantly comprise people from Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.

To date, we have held three Pop-Up Museums at the Rosmini Community Centre on March 14, April 4 and 18, 2019.
