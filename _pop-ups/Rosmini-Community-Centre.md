The <a href="https://www.rosminicentrewisbech.org">Rosmini Community Centre</a> is a community based organisation in Wisbech which provides employment support and translation services, legal advice, community transport and a range of activities for local residents spanning basketball, table tennis, football, woodworking and day outings. Located on Queens Road, on the other side of the town to the Oasis Community Centre, it provides a particular refuge for Wisbech's migrant communities, who predominantly comprise Polish, Latvians and Lithuanians.

To date, we have held three Pop-Up Museums at the Rosmini Community Centre on March 14, April 4 and 18, 2019. We also attended the Easter Fun Day event which was one of our busiest sessions! At a typical Pop-Up at the Rosmini, we usually have around 10 meaningful engagements with visitors. At the Easter event, that number tripled! The event was aimed at children, so we made lots of Egyptian paintbrushes. Unfortunately to make our journey back to Cambridge we had to leave the event early, which was a shame as everyone was having so much fun.

A significant outcome from the Rosmini Community Centre was some organised bus trips to the Fitzwilliam Museum with tours of the Egyptian galleries. We had met Stuart from [Age UK](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/) at one of our Pop-Ups at the Rosmini and he explained that he arranges day trips for his group. It was a joy to accommodate his group, who came from Wisbech and Somersham. They enjoyed coffee and sandwiches and a personal tour of the Egyptian galleries to see our coffin sets!
