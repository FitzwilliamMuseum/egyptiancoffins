The <a href="https://www.rosminicentrewisbech.org">Rosmini Community Centre</a> is a community based organisation in Wisbech which provides employment support and translation services, legal advice, community transport and a range of activities for local residents spanning basketball, table tennis, football, woodworking and day outings. Located on Queens Road, on the other side of the town to the [Oasis Community Centre](https://egyptiancoffins.org/popups/oasis-community), it provides a particular refuge for Wisbech's migrant communities, who predominantly comprise Polish, Latvians and Lithuanians.

To date, we have held three Pop-Up Museums at the Rosmini Community Centre on March 14, April 4 and 18, 2019. The latter was the Easter Fun Day event and one of the busiest sessions we have had. At a typical Pop-Up at the Rosmini, we usually have around 10 meaningful engagements (3 minutes or longer) with visitors. At the Easter event, however, that number tripled. Given that the event was aimed at children, the most popular part of our Pop-Up was the ancient Egyptian painting activity where children enjoyed making and using their own replica paintbrushes.

A significant outcome from our Pop-Ups at the Rosmini Community Centre have been two organised bus trips bringing residents from Wisbech to the Fitzwilliam Museum to enjoy a curator-led tour of the Egyptian galleries, a general Museum visit and a special tea and lunch. The first took place on 28th May where about 20 members of the Cambridgeshire Friendship Club (part of AgeUK), led by Friendship Club Coordinator Stewart Goodacre, enjoyed a day out at the Museum. The second visit was a bus group of 9 Rosmini Community Centre users who visited on 14th June. You can see some photos from their visit below.
