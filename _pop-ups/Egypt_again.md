From November 2023 to January 2024, the Pop-Up Museum team from the 
Fitzwilliam Museum began to work in association with 
[Wassla](https://www.facebook.com/people/Wassla/61553605722437/?mibextid=LQQJ4d), 
an Egyptian initiative for heritage and culture. Together they planned a number of community
outreach activities around Egypt, including talks and Pop-Up Museum activities. 

A Pop-Up Museum is where real researchers (including Egyptologists and conservators) 
bring real museum objects, craft replicas,hands-on activities and digital experiences into
the heart of communities. You can read more about the Pop-Up Museum [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/pop-ups)
and [here](https://doi.org/10.11588/cipeg.2020.4.83936).


We started our outreach tour in Cairo where we held our Pop-Up at Egypt Designers 
School. It was attended by furniture designers, university professors, artists,
students and also students from the Royal Danish Academy who were in Egypt for an ancient
Egyptian inspired furniture design workshop, in collaboration with 
[Designdustry](https://www.facebook.com/DESiGNDUSTRY/) and 
[Pinocchio](https://pinocchio-furniture.com/) Carpentry Factory in Damietta, both of which
we often collaborate with in our Pop-Up activities in Egypt.


After Cairo, we went to Damietta, a city famous as the hub of [woodwork and furniture 
making](/images/news/9.jpg) since the late 19th century, where we did a Pop-Up for the second 
time with design students at the Pinocchio Carpentry Factory. Our first time there was in 2019 
where all the factory workers were involved and exchanged making techniques between the past and 
the present with us. You can read more about our first Pop-Up in Damietta 
[here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/Alexandriaworkshop).
While we were in Damietta, it was fascinating to witness the development of the ancient 
Egyptian inspired designs of the Egyptian and Danish designers which coincidentally
overlapped with our Pop-Ups and created a positive atmosphere, all inspired by ancient 
Egypt and triggering engaging conversations. 


We also visited the local carpenters in Damietta as well as the boat makers at Ezbet El 
Borg, a nearby coastal city with a large fishing and [boat making industry](/images/news/10.jpg). 
We were interested to see the materials and wood, how that compares to the boat makers 
in Alexandria, and think about how it might relate to ancient Egyptian woodwork practices. 


We then travelled to upper Egypt where we did Pop-Ups in both Esna and Luxor. In Esna, 
we organised it with [Takween](https://www.takween-eg.com/) a company for integrated community
development. The Pop-Up took place at [the local historic market](/images/news/1.jpg), 
just across from the ancient Egyptian temple of Esna. [A diverse range of locals](/images/news/2.jpg) 
including shop keepers, workers, craftsmen, tour guides, school children, and locals who 
live close by, participated. People were so engaged that some of them went back home and 
[brought their tools](/images/news/3.jpg) which they felt had a lot in common with the 
[ancient Egyptian replica tools we had](/images/news/8.JPEG). 
They were also given the chance to try the ancient Egyptian tools such as the bow drill. 
School children were passing by on their way home so they curiously stopped and started 
making their own ancient Egyptian brushes and had a go at [painting with it](/images/news/6.JPEG).
After a couple of hours of very interesting sharing and exchange of ideas, it was very hard 
to wrap up as more and more people kept joining us. Some were even slowing down and stopping
to ask questions while they were [riding on their motorbikes](/images/news/7.jpg)! One of 
the memorable things was meeting children who have never been out of Esna, and hence have 
never been to a museum before since there is none there. We had a chat with them about the
idea of a museum and showed them pictures about what it can look like. 
That’s how surprising Pop-Ups can be and this is exactly what it is about: taking the 
museum out to people, especially to those who might be deprived of the opportunity to 
experience it. We also met another young boy who, it seems, never had the privilege of 
going to school. He stayed with us for the whole time of the Pop-Up event where he 
absolutely mastered the [dismantling and assembly of the replica dog coffin](/images/news/5.jpg), 
which is part of the Pop-Up, that he even started showing others how to do it. 
As we left, he followed us on his bike waving goodbye and smiling. 


While we were there, we visited the surroundings of the historic market including Esna 
Temple, historic houses and a Mamluk mosque. We believe it's very important when working 
with any community to understand their heritage, history and traditions. It always helps 
a lot to connect with people and develop our outreach content and practices in relevance. 
It is something to be built over time and requires creating a network based on friendly 
approach with the locals and continuity.


We left Esna to Luxor where our Pop-Up took place in Thebes University. Students of 
different specialities joined us enthusiastically and eagerly to discuss more about the 
ancient Egyptian art and wood making. One of the students, Mariam, expressed her desire 
to focus her studies on ancient Egyptian art and design. She spent the rest of the time 
chatting with us, asking questions, receiving advice on academic references and even 
ended helping us with the Pop-Up, where she demonstrated the replica tools to other 
students and also how to [re-assemble the replica dog coffin](/images/news/11.jpg).


During our time in Luxor, we were invited for a meal at Abdel Rahman’s family, a local 
who had been a senior inspector and had worked in archaeological excavations before,
including on [the tomb of Senneferi (TT99)](https://tt99.fitz.ms/). He lives in 
Al Dabiyyah village on the West Bank near Luxor.
After our meal he took us to his friend who is a local carpenter to see his tools. At the
workshop, there was a deaf mute carpenter who was very eager to understand what we do. 
We coincidentally had ‘How to make an Egyptian coffin’ book with us so we started showing 
him the images and demonstrating with the ancient Egyptian replica tools. It was great to 
see how such engagement can overcome limitations of communication and become the common 
language to connect. 

After our return from our Upper Egyptian Pop-Up activities, we travelled back to Cairo for
two more Pop-Ups.
We received an invitation from The British University in Cairo, BUE, to give a talk 
followed by a Pop-Up. Luckily we had Julie Dawson, former head of conservation at 
the Fitzwilliam Museum and Helen Strudwick, senior curator of the ancient Egyptian 
collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum who gave a talk about ancient Egyptian woodwork making
and painting techniques to students in the Art and Design department, followed by a Pop-Up
where both students and professors participated. 


This was followed by our last Pop-up museum in Cairo at The Gayer-Anderson Museum. It is 
a historic Mamluk house where British Major and antiquities collector, R.G. Gayer-Anderson
Pasha lived from 1935 to 1942 and kept some of his collection. We set up the Pop-Up in the
[house’s garden](/images/news/12.jpg) so all museum visitors were able to see us, 
chat with us and be as curious as they wanted to be. There was a group of retired elders 
who very enthusiastically joined us, some of whom were working in fields relevant to museums 
and Egyptology, so they shared and exchanged experience with us. The rest of the participants
were families, university students, and tourists. In all Pop-Ups we also have replicas of ancient 
Egyptian joints and connections that people can experiment with like a puzzle. One of the
students who visited us at The Gayer-Anderson Museum [made a short video](/images/news/13.jpg) 
of all the joints being dissembled and assembled. She shared her video on social media 
which intrigued people, prompting them to ask more questions. You can see the video [here](https://github.com/FitzwilliamMuseum/egyptiancoffins/assets/45968885/baac403e-ec58-4b02-a931-cd24c7495ece)!

Shortly after, we were encouraged by the head of museums sector in Egypt, Dr. Moamen 
Othman, who is a great supporter of the Pop-Up museum community outreach, to have a Pop- 
Up museum at the Graeco Roman Museum in Alexandria. We had our Pop-Up setting in the [inner 
courtyard of the museum](/images/news/14.jpg), where museum visitors could easily spot us 
on their way to the museum cafe or in passing. We spent there at least 4 hours continuously,
where we received a wide range of participants including families, university students, school children, 
tourists, museum curators. This was preceded by multiple visits, research and discussions 
with the curators at the Graeco Roman Museum to integrate the relevant collection on 
display within the Pop-Up Museum context.  


In all those Pop-Ups, we trained [volunteers](/images/news/15.jpg) to join us, some of 
whom were high school students, university students or young people at their early stage 
career. This has given them the chance to [join an experience](/images/news/16.jpg) 
they haven’t necessarily been exposed to before, know more about creative means of community
outreach and it also it added another level of diversity and inclusion which we are keen on 
in our outreach programs. 


As we ended 2023 and kicked off 2024 with these very diverse, thought-provoking, inspiring
Pop-Ups, we are looking forward to planning more of them and collaborating with more museums 
and museum professionals, entities and individuals who are interested in taking history 
and heritage out to people where they least expect find it!
