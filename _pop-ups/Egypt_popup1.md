From November 2023 to January 2024, the Pop-Up Museum team from the 
Fitzwilliam Museum began to work in association with ‘Wassla’, an Egyptian initiative 
for heritage and culture. Together they planned a number of community outreach activities
around Egypt, including talks and Pop-Up Museum activities. 

A Pop-Up Museum is where real researchers (including Egyptologists and conservators) 
bring real museum objects, craft replicas,hands-on activities and digital experiences into
the heart of communities. You can read more about
the Pop-Up Museum [here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/pop-ups) and 
[here](https://doi.org/10.11588/cipeg.2020.4.83936).


We started our outreach tour in Cairo where were held our Pop-Up at Egypt Designers 
School, which was attended by furniture designers, university professors, artists,
students and also students from the Royal Danish Academy who were in Egypt for an ancient
Egyptian inspired furniture design workshop, in collaboration with Designdustry and 
Pinocchio Carpentry Factory in Damietta. 


After Cairo, we went to Damietta, a city famous as the hub of [woodwork and furniture 
making](/images/news/9.jpg) since the late 19th century, where we did a Pop-Up for the second time with design
students at the Pinocchio Carpentry Factory. Our first time there was in 2019 where all
the factory workers were involved and exchanged making techniques between the past and 
the present with us. You can read more about our first Pop-Up in Damietta 
[here](https://egyptiancoffins.org/news/Alexandriaworkshop).
While we were in Damietta, it was fascinating to witness the development of the ancient 
Egyptian inspired designs of the Egyptian and Danish designers which coincidentally
overlapped with our Pop-Ups and created a positive atmosphere, all inspired by ancient 
Egypt and triggering engaging conversations. 


We also visited the local carpenters in Damietta as well as the boat makers at Ezbet El 
Borg, a nearby coastal city with a large fishing industry and [boat making industry](/images/news/10.jpg). 
We were interested to see the materials and wood, how that compares to the boat makers 
in Alexandria, and think about how it might relate to ancient Egyptian wood work practices. 


We then travelled to upper Egypt where we did Pop-Ups in both Esna and Luxor. In Esna, 
we organised it with ‘Takween’ a company for integrated community development. The Pop-Up
took place at [the local historic market](/images/news/1.jpg), 
just across from the ancient Egyptian temple of Esna.
[A diverse range of locals](/images/news/2.jpg) including shop keepers, workers, 
craftsmen, tour guides, school
children, and locals who live close by, participated. People were so engaged that some of 
them went back home and [brought their tools](/images/news/3.jpg) which they felt had a 
lot in common with the [ancient Egyptian replica tools we had](/images/news/8.JPEG). 
They were also given the chance to try the ancient 
Egyptian tools such as the bow drill. School children were passing by on their way home 
so they curiously stopped and started making their own ancient Egyptian brushes and 
had a go at [painting with it](/images/news/6.JPEG). After a couple of hours of very 
interesting sharing and 
exchange of ideas, it was very hard to wrap up as more and more people kept joining us.
Some were even slowing down and stopping to ask questions while they were [riding on their 
motorbikes](/images/news/7.jpg)! One of the memorable things was meeting children 
who have never been out of
Esna, and hence have never been to a museum before since there is none there. 
We had a chat with 
them about the idea of a museum and showed them pictures about what it can look like. 
That’s how surprising Pop-Ups can be and this is exactly what it is about: taking the 
museum out to people, especially to those who might be deprived of the opportunity to 
experience it. We also had another young boy who to have never had the privilege of 
going to school. He stayed with us for the whole time of the Pop-Up event where he 
absolutely mastered the [dismantling and assembly of the replica dog coffin](/images/news/5.jpg), 
which is part of the Pop-Up, so that 
he even started showing others how to do it. As we left, he followed us on his bike waving
goodbye and smiling. 


While we were there, we visited the surroundings of the historic market including Esna 
Temple, historic houses and a Mamluk mosque. We believe it's very important when working 
with any community to understand their heritage, history and traditions. It always helps 
a lot to connect with people and develop our outreach content and practices in relevance. 
It is something to be built over time and requires creating a network based on friendly 
approach with the locals and continuity.


We left Esna to Luxor where our Pop-Up took place in Thebes University. Students of 
different specialities joined us enthusiastically and eagerly to discuss more about the 
ancient Egyptian art and wood-making. One of the students, Mariam, expressed her desire 
to focus her studies on ancient Egyptian art and design. She spent the rest of the time 
chatting with us, asking questions, receiving advice on academic references and even 
ended helping us with the Pop-Up, where she demonstrated the replica tools to other 
students and also how to [re-assemble the replica dog coffin](/images/news/11.jpg).


During our time in Luxor, we were invited for a meal at Abdel Rahman’s family, a local 
who had been a senior inspector and had worked in archaeological excavations before,
including on [the tomb of Senneferi (TT99)](https://tt99.fitz.ms/). He lives in 
Al Dabiyyah village on the West Bank near Luxor.
After our meal he took us to his friend who is a local carpenter to see his tools. At the
workshop, there was a deaf mute carpenter who was very eager to understand what we do. 
We coincidentally had ‘How to make an Egyptian coffin’ book with us so we started showing 
him the images and demonstrating with the ancient Egyptian replica tools. It was great to 
see how such engagement can overcome limitations of communication and become the common 
language to connect.
