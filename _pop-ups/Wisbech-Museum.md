Opened in 1847 as one of the first purpose built museums in the UK, and still very much retaining its period charm, the Wisbech and Fenland Museum is home to a rich and diverse collection spanning local and social history, decorative and fine arts, ethnography, photography, costume and textiles, natural history, numismatics, archaeology and Egyptology. It's located in Museum Square between the town library, St Peter and St Paul's Parish and [Wisbech Castle](http://wisbechcastle.org).   

Since we first conceived the idea of the Pop-Up project in mid-2018, we have collaborated and consulted with staff and volunteers at the Wisbech and Fenland Museum. This has mainly been in regard to identifying venues for our Pop-Up in Wisbech, developing a small exhibition display at the Museum of some 21st Dynasty yellow coffin fragments in their collection, which directly relates to our research and identifying ways in which we can help grow visitation to the Museum.

Therefore, on 21st May 2019, we trialled our Egyptian Coffins Pop-Up outside the Wisbech and Fenland Museum with the aim of capturing passers-by, as well as school and other community groups on excursion. From personal experience, we have also witnessed pockets of nuisance behaviour in the thouroughfare and neighbouring Church yard, so we wanted to see what effect our Pop-Up would have in a) reducing this type of behaviour and b) encouraging cultural and social interaction with us.
