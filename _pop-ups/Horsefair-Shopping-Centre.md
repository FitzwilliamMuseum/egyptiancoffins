Located in central Wisbech, the Horsefair Shopping Centre is a hub of activity for locals with 26 retail outlets. It is also home to Wisbech's main bus depot.

We â€˜Popped-Up' at the Horsefair Shopping Centre on two different occasions on April 9 and again for their Easter Funfair event on April 17. The latter featured a range of activities, including an Easter egg hunt, choir, food stalls, face painting and rides, and attracted more than 2000 people. Unsurprisingly, the main demographic at this event were families with young children, which meant our paintbrush making activity was particularly busy! But, it provided an excellent opportunity to have many meaningful engagements with parents while their children were occupied with painting (43 altogether). At our 'Pop-Up' on April 9, on the other hand, we recorded 23 meaningful engagements and 100 impressions made by passers-by. 

We would like to extend a very warm thank you to Kevin Smith, Manager of the Horsefair Shopping Centre in Wisbech for helping to facilitate our visits.
