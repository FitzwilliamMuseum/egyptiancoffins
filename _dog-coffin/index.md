This small wooden box coffin, believed to be for a dog, was discovered by John Garstang at Beni Hasan in 1902. Measuring H. 27cm, W. 70cm and D. 20cm, the coffin is made from eight pieces of Lebanese cedar wood (_Cedrus Libani_) with mitred corners held together by dowels. The exterior of the coffin is painted yellow with a band of hieroglyphic text extending around each side and on the lid, which is only partly preserved. The text indicates the owner of the coffin was named Heb.

A replica of this coffin was made by ancient woodworking specialist, Dr Geoffrey Killen, in March 2019 for an outreach project of the Museum in the Wisbech and Fenlands area. See images and video below. The coffin has also been published by Angela Tooley in the 1988 edition of the _Journal of Egyptian Archaeology_.
