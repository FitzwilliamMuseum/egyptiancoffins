In order to help those connecting to the conference remotely, who are in parts of the world that are a long way from the UK, we have asked speakers 
if for permission to record their presentations so that they can been shared on-line with registered participants while the
conference is happening. Links to these recordings will be made available here during the course of the conference. Please note, however, that not all
speakers have agreed to this.

Some presenters have also agreed to allow their presentations to remain available until 24 March, and those will remain available from this page 
until that date.
