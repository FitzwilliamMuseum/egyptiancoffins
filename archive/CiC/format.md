The conference will be hybrid; details about how to connect will be shared in due course.

The conference language will be English. 

Papers will last no more than 20 minutes, with 5 minutes allocated for questions, and will be grouped together in appropriate sessions, 
followed by a period of discussion. In addition, within the sessions there will be short-form presentations of 10 minutes length, 
with no opportunity for immediate questions, but they will be included in the discussions. 

There will also be poster presentations during each break, and posters that are of particular relevance to sessions will be highlighted. 

The conference concludes on Saturday afternoon with a plenary discussion on where coffin studies might go next. This will be led by invited
speakers.
