In this video, expert in ancient Egyptian woodworking, [Dr Geoffrey Killen](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/geoff-killen/), demonstrates how the panels used in Roman period mummy portraits were prepared and carved. This is done via a reconstruction modelled on the ancient mummy portrait of Demos from Hawara (AD 75-100) held in the collection of the Egyptian Museum Cairo (CG 33237). The reconstruction is carefully made based on a detailed examination of the reverse of the portraits held in the Fitzwilliam Museum's collection, as well as the original technology and materials used in other surviving portraits.
