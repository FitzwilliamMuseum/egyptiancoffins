In this video, [Helen Strudwick](https://egyptiancoffins.org/team/helen-strudwick/), Curator of Egyptian Antiquities at the Fitzwilliam Museum, shares one type of effective outreach project which can dramatically broaden the reach of high-end research to diverse audiences. Known as the [‘Pop-Up’ Museum](https://egyptiancoffins.org/pop-ups), the video demonstrates in a very practical way how you can design and deliver your own ‘Pop-Up’ using the research generated from the Roman period mummy portraits project as a case study.
