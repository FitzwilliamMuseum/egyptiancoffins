**Object name:** 
Coffin fragment

**Accession no.:**

“W.66” in ink

**Dimensions:**

**Brief description:** 

Fragment from the proper left (east side) of the coffin of the master
physician, Wepwawetemhat (meaning ‘Wepwawet is at the front’) showing a
man dragging a cow and ibex. As is common with coffins of this type,
there are four columns of text next to the scenes, including two
hetep-di-nswt formulas.

With E.W.66a, thesee are two relatively small coffin boards. They present 
the remains of scenes in the middle and text columns at the sides. All 
hieroglyphs and figures are looking to the right. Both boards therefore come 
from the left (east) side of a coffin. On both fragments are always four text 
columns next to the scenes. The line on a belong to two hetep-di-n formula
common on coffins found at Asyut: Htp di n ra-itmw Hna Drt.f (an
offering given to Ra-Atum and his hand) and Htp di n gb Hna nwt (an
offering given to Geb and Nut). The next column block seems to consist
of imahy xr formulae including the name and title of the coffin
owner.

The coffin owner has the name Wepwawetemhat, which was especially
popular at Asyut in the Middle Kingdom. He bears the title ‘greatest of
the physicians’. There are many coffins and coffin fragments known from
Asyut, but only a few of them bear titles. Interestingly there is in the
Museum of Tanta a coffin of a certain Wepay with the same title. Wepay
might be the abbreviation of Wepwawetemhat and both coffins might belong
to the same person. However, this is only a guess.

The plank is made from a tangentially cut piece of wood, the grain
running along the length. There are six dowel holes in the plank, three
of which still contain wooden dowels. The back and long sides of the
panel are coated with an irregular layer of white and yellow calcite
paste. The lower sides also have a layer of reddish materials over the
paste, possibly animal glue.

The external face is coated with a fine white calcite preparation layer.
A red under-drawing is visible around the decorative elements. These are
illustrated with green, blue (Egyptian Blue), brown and red and overlain
by a black outline. The kilt of the standing figure is filled with white
calcite pigment that overlies the red outlining.
