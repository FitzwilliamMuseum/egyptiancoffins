**Object name:** 
Fragment from the coffin of the master physician, Wepwawetemhat 

**Accession no.:** 
E.W.66a

**Other numbers and markings:*
“W.66” in ink

**Dimensions:** 
H 8.9 cm
W 3.4 cm
D 75.3 cm

**Brief description:** 

Fragment from the proper left (east side) of the coffin of the master
physician, Wepwawetemhat (meaning ‘Wepwawet is at the front’) showing a
man dragging a cow with two standing women behind him. 

With E.W.66b, these are two relatively small coffin boards. They present the remains
of scenes in the middle and text columns at the sides. All hieroglyphs and figures are looking to the right. Both
boards therefore come from the left (east) side of a coffin. On both fragments are always four text columns
next to the scenes. The line on a belong to two hetep-di-n formula
common on coffins found at Asyut: Htp di n ra-itmw Hna Drt.f (an
offering given to Ra-Atum and his hand) and Htp di n gb Hna nwt (an
offering given to Geb and Nut). The next column block seems to consist
of imahy xr formulae including the name and title of the coffin
owner.

The coffin owner has the name Wepwawetemhat, which was especially
popular at Asyut in the Middle Kingdom. He bears the title ‘greatest of
the physicians’. There are many coffins and coffin fragments known from
Asyut, but only a few of them bear titles. Interestingly there is in the
Museum of Tanta a coffin of a certain Wepay with the same title. Wepay
might be the abbreviation of Wepwawetemhat and both coffins might belong
to the same person. However, this is only a guess.

The coffin panel
is made from a single piece of radially cut wood (sycomore fig), where
the grain runs along the length. There are five dowel holes, one with a
deformed dowel surviving. Dowels would have been used to connect
separate planks together to form the coffin. As is common with coffins
of this type, there are four columns of text next to the scenes,
including two hetep-di-nswt formulas.

The external face of the panel is coated with a white preparation layer
(this was observed under PLM and thought to be calcite from ground
limestone), which is used as a background to the hieroglyphs and
figures. A red under-drawing is visible in places. A faint red outline
of the cow’s front proper left leg is visible adjacent to its finished
position indicating an alteration to the drawing. This and other
pigments were also examined with PLM to attempt identification, though
the results are yet to be confirmed by other analytical techniques (XRF
or FORS). The reds show characteristics that are compatible with
cinnabar, while the green pigment particles resemble Egyptian Green.
Where it is thickly applied, the black paint shows brush marks. The
pigment particles are very fine, and likely to be soot. The blues have
been identified as Egyptian Blue using VIL. The yellow pigment is likely
to be a mixture of calcite and orpiment. The blue feathers and black
outlining on the bird on the far proper left overlie the yellow face
colour.

The back and long sides of the plank are patchily coated with a white
and yellow-brown ground. There are also areas of possible animal glue.
These sides were probably adhered to other planks with this material
alongside the dowels.
