**Brief description:** 

This is part of the footboard from a white anthropoid coffin, made of several pieces of sycomore fig joined using animal glue, acacia and sidr dowels and loose tenons. Poorly fitting joints have been packed out with wedges of wood, a gritty paste/mud or fabric scraps. It is decorated with a figure of Isis, whose name is written above her left arm and (in abbreviated form) on her head. 

The surface is partially covered with a coarse yellow preparation layer (made of calcite, gypsum and bassanite) overlaid with a white coat (containing natural chalk). There is a pink underdrawing of Isis, who is painted with yellow earth, red earth, carbon-based black and Egyptian green.
