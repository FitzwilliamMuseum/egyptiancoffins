**Brief description:** 

The shape of this head suggests that it came from a sarcophagus of the
Thirtieth Dynasty or early Ptolemaic Period. A white calcite preparation
layer was applied to the roughly finished exterior surface to even it
out and prepare it for gilding. Gold leaf was applied across the flesh.
Black eyebrows, and eye outlines and pupils are just visible. Egyptian
blue was used for the wig, but there has been significant surface loss
and subsequent restoration (probably carried out in the early twentieth
century).

**Date:**
Thirtieth Dynasty or early Ptolemaic Period
