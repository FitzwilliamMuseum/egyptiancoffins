**Object name:** 
Miniature coffin

**Accession no.:** 
E.43.1907

**Other numbers and markings:**
tbd

**Dimensions:** 
H 43.8 cm

**Brief description:** 

This miniature coffin was
carefully made from two pieces
of cedar wood. It originally
had painted decoration and
an inscription, and was held
together with pegged tenons,
just like a full-size coffin. The
wood is severely deteriorated
and no pigment remains. The
coffin may originally have been
made to hold the internal organs
from a mummified body. The
contents, surrounded by black
resin that has pooled towards
the foot end of the coffin, are not
yet securely identified but might
be the body of an infant.

**Date:**
c. 664â€“525 BC
