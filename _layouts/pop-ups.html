          With the generous support of the Arts and Humanities Impact Fund (University of Cambridge), a small team from the <a href="https://egyptiancoffins.org/about">Fitzwilliam Egyptian Coffins project</a> have been piloting a Pop-Up Museum in <a href="https://www.visitcambridge.org/beyond-cambridge/wisbech">Wisbech</a> (from March-June, 2019). The aim of this is to bring our cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research into ancient Egyptian coffins into culturally underserved communities with the view to replicating this elsewhere, and with different research projects and collections. We have selected Wisbech, located in the heart of the Fens (about 1 hour 20 minutes from central Cambridge by car), given that it is <a href="https://www.cambstimes.co.uk/news/more-than-70-000-people-in-poverty-in-cambridgeshire-1-6093858">reported</a> to be one of the most deprived towns not only in Cambridgeshire, but the whole of the UK. According to the <a href="https://cambridgeshireinsight.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Wisbech-2020-Baseline-Evidence-Profile-2016.pdf">2011 Census</a>, for example, 35.1% of residents were recorded as having no formal qualifications, while 19.1% had below the national standard average levels in literacy.
          </p>
          <p>
          But, what is a Pop-Up Museum? And how do we engage audiences using this type of platform? Well, a Pop-Up Museum is where real researchers (including Egyptologists and conservators) bring real museum objects, craft replicas, hands-on activities and digital experiences into the heart of communities who might not otherwise have access to our research. We aim to do this, however, in surprising and unexpected ways by popping-up in locations where having a cultural encounter is perhaps the last thing on someone's mind. For example, we have popped-up in a pub, supermarket, shopping centre and a food bank. We have also popped-up outside the Wisbech and Fenland Museum and in the Rosmini and Oasis Community Centres. 

          </p>
          <p>
          We connect people with our research through face-to-face interaction and the lens of how things are made, bridging people's knowledge and experience of trades and recreational pastimes, such as carpentry and painting, with the skills of the ancient Egyptians from thousands of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
          Below you will find a list of all the venues we have popped-up in between March and June 2019, including a venue summary, photographs and reflections of our experiences there. In due course, we will also be uploading an official full-length report of our project and a practical set of guidelines instructing other museums and cultural institutions how to develop and deliver their own Pop-Up Museum. For example, with the support of the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/research/global-challenges-research-fund/">Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF)</a>, in July 2019 we will be delivering our first Pop-Up Museum in Cairo. We will also be training curators at the Egyptian Museum Cairo so they can develop and deliver their own.
