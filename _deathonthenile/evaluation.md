91,782 people visited 'Death on the Nile', indicating a very high level of public interest. The conservation lab enabled members of the public to develop their understanding of ancient artefacts by asking questions about the objects on display, the materials and technology used in their original construction and the imaging and analytical methods used. Several visitors commented that their attitudes to the ethics of conservation had been shaped and that their interest in the exhibition and the research it presented had been stimulated. A tracking study following 10 visitors around the exhibition found an average viewing time of 42 minutes and 46 seconds, indicating deep engagement with the content.
