'Death on the Nile: Uncovering the Afterlife of Ancient Egypt' explores the fascinating world of ancient Egyptian burial customs and practices. Examining objects from the Fitzwilliam Museum’s collection, with the aid of scientific analysis and imaging, this beautifully illustrated volume deepens our understanding of the lives and concerns of ancient Egyptians as they prepared themselves for death and burial.

Four essays by leading academics investigate every aspect of the Fitzwilliam’s impressive collection of coffins, and shed new light on their production in the workshops of ancient Egypt. They trace the religious beliefs of the people for whom the coffins were created and how those beliefs changed over time. Comparisons of contemporaneous coffins reveal how the economic and political structure of the period determined the burial options available. Choices of materials and methods used to create the coffins add to the human story of daily concerns and aspirations of the customer and practical realities for the craftsman.

The catalogue section examines and displays over 50 objects from the Museum’s and other collections, and is accompanied by narrative commentary that places them in their historical and cultural context. The book also includes an illustrated glossary and an index.

'Death on the Nile: Uncovering the Afterlife of Ancient Egypt' is available to buy [online](https://www.museumbookstore.com/products/death-on-the-nile-uncovering-the-afterlife-of-ancient-egypt) and at the Fitzwilliam Museum shop.
