Between 23 February and 22 May 2016, the Fitzwilliam Museum exhibited 'Death on the Nile: Uncovering the Afterlife of Ancient Egypt'. The Museum's first major exhibition as part of its 2016 bicentenenary celebrations, the exhibition went beyond the images of mummies, pharaohs and mystery often associated with ancient Egypt by showcasing how coffin design developed over 4,000 years, reflecting significant changes both in the status of affluent ancient Egyptians and in the gods that were important to them. This webpage is thus an archival resource for the exhibition and its associated publication and international conference.
