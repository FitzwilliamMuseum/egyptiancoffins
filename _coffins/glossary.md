## Terms in use throughout our project

This page gives a short glossary and visual aid to terms our project uses when discussing coffin fabrication.

### Coffin box

The part of the coffin in which the body was placed. The term is used here for both rectangular box coffins and anthropoid
coffins.

### Coffin lid

The part of the coffin that was placed on top of the box. In an anthropoid coffin, this would be the part that resembles
the front of the head and body of the person.

### Coffin base

The bottom (long axis) of the coffin box.

### Footboard

The short panel at the foot end of the coffin box and lid.


## Wood working terminology

### Tangential Sawing

Also known as through-and-through or slash sawing. The trunk or log is sawn down its long axis. Timber cut this way can
be recognised by the slash-grain pattern on the planks. It is the most economical way to cut up timber, but the planks
are prone to 'cup' because the wood dries and shrinks unevenly across the width of the plank.

## Materials

### Cartonnage

A laminated material constructed of layers of linen or papyrus soaked in glue, with a layer of paste on the internal and 
on the external surface.

### Papyrus

A writing material made from the inner pith of papyrus plant (_Cyperus papyrus_) stems. The term papyrus (plural: papyri) 
is used also to describe documents made from this material.

## Faience 
A term that has been used to describe a range of glazed composition materials, but is usually defined as a shaped core made 
of crushed quartz or sand mixed with small quantities of lime and natron or plant ash, coated with a glaze and fired in a 
kiln. The glazes usually contain copper, which gives the faience a blue-green colour.

## Frit

A name commonly applied to Egyptian glassy materials. Frit has the same composition and structure all the way through the 
material (as opposed to the distinct core and glaze layer of faience). The pigment Egyptian blue is a frit. If it was ground 
up, mixed to a paste with water, then shaped and refired, an object made of blue frit (e.g., an amulet) could be produced.

## Paste 

In describing Egyptian objects, the term 'plaster' is often used rather loosely to cover both true plasters (made from lime 
or gypsum cements) and pastes made from a binder (such as animal glue) mixed with calcium sulphate (often called gesso) or 
with calcium carbonate (often called whiting). To avoid confusion and to address the fact that sometimes mixtures of all 
these materials can be present, together with clay minerals and vegetable fibres, the term 'paste is used in our research 
project as it implies no particular chemistry or technology. 

## Preparation layer 

A layer of paste applied across the coffin to provide a smooth, neutral surface to which paint can be applied. Sometimes 
known as a 'ground' layer.
