## Terms in use throughout our project

This page gives a short glossary and visual aid to terms our project uses when discussing coffin fabrication.

### Coffin box

The part of the coffin in which the body was placed. The term is used here for both rectangular box coffins and anthropoid
coffins.

### Coffin lid

The part of the coffin that was placed on top of the box. In an anthropoid coffin, this would be the part that resembles
the front of the head and body of the person.

### Coffin base

The bottom (long axis) of the coffin box.

### Footboard

The short panel at the foot end of the coffin box and lid.


## Wood working terminology

### Tangential Sawing

Also known as through-and-through or slash sawing. The trunk or log is sawn down its long axis. Timber cut this way can
be recognised by the slash-grain pattern on the planks. It is the most economical way to cut up timber, but the planks
are prone to 'cup' because the wood dries and shrinks unevenly across the width of the plank.

## Materials

### Cartonnage

A laminated material constructed of layers of linen or papyrus soaked in glue, with a layer of paste on the internal and 
on the external surface.

### Papyrus

A writing material made from the inner pith of papyrus plant (_Cyperus papyrus_) stems. The term papyrus (plural: papyri) 
is used also to describe documents made from this material.

## Faience 
A term that has been used to describe a range of glazed composition materials, but is usually defined as a shaped core made 
of crushed quartz or sand mixed with small quantities of lime and natron or plant ash, coated with a glaze and fired in a 
kiln. The glazes usually contain copper, which gives the faience a blue-green colour.

## Frit

A name commonly applied to Egyptian glassy materials. Frit has the same composition and structure all the way through the 
material (as opposed to the distinct core and glaze layer of faience). The pigment Egyptian blue is a frit. If it was ground 
up, mixed to a paste with water, then shaped and refired, an object made of blue frit (e.g., an amulet) could be produced.

## Paste 

In describing Egyptian objects, the term 'plaster' is often used rather loosely to cover both true plasters (made from lime 
or gypsum cements) and pastes made from a binder (such as animal glue) mixed with calcium sulphate (often called gesso) or 
with calcium carbonate (often called whiting). To avoid confusion and to address the fact that sometimes mixtures of all 
these materials can be present, together with clay minerals and vegetable fibres, the term 'paste is used in our research 
project as it implies no particular chemistry or technology. 

## Preparation layer 

A layer of paste applied across the coffin to provide a smooth, neutral surface to which paint can be applied. Sometimes 
known as a 'ground' layer. 

## Egyptian painting materials: A quick guide to the principal pigments 

When it has not been possible to characterise pigments fully, their elemental make up has been recorded as, for example, 'calcium-based' or 'copper-based'. 

**Egyptian blue** and **Egyptian green** Manufactured pigments, prepared by firing copper minerals or metal with a calcium compound (like powdered limestone), silica and soda at high temperature. The principal colour component in Egyptian blue is calcium copper tetrasilicate (CaCuSi_4 O_10), and in Egyptian green is cupro-wollastonite (CaSiO_3 with copper in the structure). 

**Malachite (Cu2CO3(OH)2)** A mineral pigment, giving a pale green colour.

**Chrysocolla (Cu2H2Si2O5(OH)4)** A mineral pigment with a turquoise blue colour. 

**Copper-wax, copper-proteinate, copper carbohydrate** Green pigments produced from the reaction of copper salts with various organic media.

**Verdigris (copper acetate)** A copper salt that can be manufactured or found as a corrosion product. Produces a bright green colour.

**Earths** This is an umbrella term used to describe a range of pigments derived from naturally occurring deposits containing clay minerals, iron oxides and manganese oxides. They can be found in a range of shades depending on the purity and specific chemical structure of the natural sources, and can include red, yellow, orange and green pigments. The term 'earth' may be confused with ochre, which is a member of the earth pigments group, consisting of earths rich in iron oxide and iron hydroxide. Earths on ancient Egyptian objects may contain one or more of the following:

•	Yellow earths The iron sulphates jarosite/natrojarosite (KFe3(OH)6(SO4)2/ NaFe3(SO4)2(OH)6), and the iron oxides goethite (α-FeO·OH) and limonite (FeO(OH)·nH2O).
•	Red earths The iron oxides haematite (Fe2O3) and ilmenite (FeTiO3). 
•	Green earths Celadonite and glauconite (iron magnesium silicates belonging to the mica group).  
As these pigments arise from naturally occurring deposits, they often occur as a mixture and are not always easily classifiable. Where it has been possible to further identify particular pigments, this has been indicated. 
Calcite (CaCO3) Calcium carbonate. 
•	Micritic calcite Microscopy term to describe calcite visible as very fine particles, usually originating from chalk. 
•	Sparitic calcite Microscopy term to describe calcite that forms into crystals, usually suggesting limestone origin.
Huntite (Mg3Ca(CO3)4) Magnesium calcium carbonate, a bright white pigment. 
Gyspum (CaSO4· 2H2O) Calcium sulphate.
•	Bassanite (CaSO4· ½H2O) Made from roasting gypsum at high temperatures, sometimes found naturally. Modern equivalent is plaster of Paris. 
•	Anhydrite (CaSO4) Completely dehydrated version of gypsum sometimes found naturally, or produced by heating above 200oC (392oF).
Lead white (PbCO3Pb(OH)2) Lead carbonate, an opaque white pigment. 
Red lead (Pb3O4) Lead tetroxide, a bright orange-red pigment. 
Cinnabar (HgS) Mercury sulphide, a vivid red mineral pigment.
Orpiment (As2S3) Arsenic sulphide, a lemon yellow pigment.
Realgar/pararealgar (As4S4) Arsenic sulphide (but different crystal structures), orange pigments. Pararealgar is a degradation product of realgar. 
Carbon-based black A group of pigments made mainly of carbon. In Egypt, these are principally soot and charcoal. 
Lake pigments Also known as dyestuffs, these are organic pigments that can be made from certain insect or plant matter. The colour is extracted and precipitated onto a metallic salt substrate. Lake pigments found on Egyptian objects include: 
•	Madder Pink dyestuff made from the root of the madder plant Rubia tinctorum fixed on a mineral base such as aluminium sulphate. 
•	Indigo Blue dyestuff from plants of the Indigofera species fixed on a mineral base.
